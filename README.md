# DnDCharacterGenerator
Randomly generates the information necessary for an offical Dungeons & Dragons 5th edition character sheet.

Note: This project has not yet reached its final form! Currently only generates some of the information. The most up-to-date version of this project can be found in the dev branch until the next release.

## Future Features
* First and foremost, this application will be able to generate all the information for the first page of a 5th edition character sheet.
* Once that has been accomplished, a GUI will be implemented with [wxWidgets](http://wxwidgets.org).
* Once a GUI has been implemented, the user will have more control over how a character is randomly generated through an advanced options menu.
  * Options may include things like choosing to start with only gold and no equipment.
* Beyond that, a full three-page character sheet will be able to be generated.
